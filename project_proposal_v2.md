# Final Project Proposal Version 2.0

- Group name: Purple
- Group Member: Breanna Bernardino, Sharon Zhang


- Concept Description:
Our program will allow users to play card game Hearts with other human players 
or computer players. Our program will allow 3-5 players and some rules will be slightly different depending on the number of players. Basically, the program 
will simulate the actual game. It will keep track of players' score at the end 
of each hand based on the hearts they have and the queen spade if they have. 
The game will be played to 100 points. When one player hits the agreed-upon 
score or higher, the game ends. And the player with the lowest score wins.


- Scoring function/method: Sharon
This function will calculate the score for each player at the end of each hand.
    - Hearts count as one point each and the queen counts 13 points;
    - Total of all scores for each hand must be a multiple of 26
    - If exactly get 26(13 hearts and one queen), score set to 0, but each of opponents score an additional 26
    - Is usually played to 100 points
Args:

    cards current play have)
Side Effects:
    - Modify current playerâ€™s score attribute
    - Print out score
Returns:
